Our goal is to offer medical professionals and certified prosthetist orthotists (CPO) the possibility to create individual orthoses online in a cost- and time-saving way. To this end, Mecuris translates traditional craftsmanship into digital tools and workflows and makes them available in its web-based digital workshop - the Mecuris Solution Platform.\nThis easy-to-use platform makes it possible to combine classic craftsmanship with the benefits of digitization. The platform can be used intuitively, which means that the CPO does not need to have prior knowledge of 3D technologies. From posture correction of a user scan to orthosis modeling and configuration: all processes for creating an orthosis can be carried out digitally, either in individual steps or as a whole. Afterwards, the finished item can be manufactured in the preferred milling or 3D printing facility.\nThe individual components of the digital services are constantly being developed further and offered in a flexible freemium plan. This means that medical supply stores of any size can make a quick and economic start on digitization. Using the digital tools of Mecuris will lead to a 100% customised fit and cuts production times by 75% for the medical practitioners and patients.\nCheck it out!\n\n\nMecuris has a young minded & international team with a central office in the heart of Munich (currently @HomeOffice).

Our goal is to offer medical professionals and certified prosthetist orthotists (CPO) the possibility to create individual orthoses online in a cost- and time-saving way. To this end, Mecuris translates traditional craftsmanship into digital tools and workflows and makes them available in its web-based digital workshop - the Mecuris Solution Platform.\nThis easy-to-use platform makes it possible to combine classic craftsmanship with the benefits of digitization. The platform can be used intuitively, which means that the CPO does not need to have prior knowledge of 3D technologies. From posture correction of a user scan to orthosis modeling and configuration: all processes for creating an orthosis can be carried out digitally, either in individual steps or as a whole. Afterwards, the finished item can be manufactured in the preferred milling or 3D printing facility.\nThe individual components of the digital services are constantly being developed further and offered in a flexible freemium plan. This means that medical supply stores of any size can make a quick and economic start on digitization. Using the digital tools of Mecuris will lead to a 100% customised fit and cuts production times by 75% for the medical practitioners and patients.\nCheck it out!\n\n\nMecuris has a young minded & international team with a central office in the heart of Munich (currently @HomeOffice). With our work we can directly influence the improvement of the quality of life of users (patients). You are looking for a new challenging position? More than just a 9-5 job?

Working closely with leadership, I enabled fast, data-driven decision-making that supported the company’s growth and eventual acquisition by SciPlay. I later led the backend and data team, managing a full cloud migration from on Premise to Azure and later on to AWS (as part of integration to Sciplay).\n\nOur infrastructure supported analytics for 2 million daily active users (DAU) and $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), playing a key role in product iteration, market responsiveness, and executive strategy.\n\nI thrive in cross-functional product teams, especially when solving non-trivial problems through clean architecture, pen-and-paper design thinking, and purposeful automation. Whether the challenge is compliance, performance, or scale, I enjoy diving deep and delivering solutions that endure.\n\nI’m driven by impact and outcomes, not trends. I believe in building solutions that are purposeful, useful, and measurable. If a technology doesn’t solve a real problem or enable decision-making, then no shiny framework or clever implementation can justify its use.\n\nAs a leader, I’ve been described as empathetic, supportive, and an enabler of growth, reflected in the number of well-earned promotions by team members I’ve mentored.

Businesses no longer need to plan and procure servers and other IT resources weeks or months in advance. Using AWS, businesses can take advantage of Amazon's expertise and economies of scale to access resources when their business needs them, delivering results faster and at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nToday, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

He didn’t just build a team—he built a culture. He brought in great people, created an environment based on trust and ownership, and encouraged everyone to step up and take real responsibility. His coaching style really helped the team grow, and the atmosphere became one where people genuinely wanted to do their best work.\n\nOne of the standout moments during his time with us was when we rebuilt our entire solution in just two months. That project was a huge lift, and thanks to his leadership, we pulled it off. The new version not only fixed a bunch of technical issues we’d been dealing with, but it also opened doors—we started getting serious interest from big names in the industry, and it helped kick off some major conversations with strategic prospects.\n\nHe also played a key role in designing a much more scalable architecture, setting us up for long-term success. His ability to zoom out and see the big picture, while still being super hands-on and approachable, made a huge difference for the team.\n\nFernando is one of those rare leaders who combines deep technical skills with a strong sense of empathy and people leadership.

It was a technically complex and fast-evolving environment, but Benoit took it in stride. He initially owned our core configuration management service, and soon after became one of the strongest Python developers on the team, proactively refactoring and improving key parts of our codebase.\n\nWhen we made the bold decision to rewrite the backend in Kotlin, Benoit didn’t hesitate. Even though it was outside his comfort zone, he took it as an opportunity, not a setback. He jumped into learning the language on his own time, asked great questions, and was up and running in Kotlin alongside his team in no time. That openness to growth and ability to adapt fast was a theme throughout our time working together.\n\nHe’s not just technical, he’s incredibly proactive. Whether it was debugging a service in a high-stakes demo without being asked, or thoroughly evaluating orchestration engines far beyond what I had expected (complete with a clear comparison framework), he constantly demonstrated initiative and ownership. He’s also grounded in product thinking: always focused on delivering something useful, something real, and something that works.\n\nBenoit also quietly helped raise the bar for others. While working in Python, he regularly guided teammates toward cleaner, more maintainable patterns. He has opinions and knows how to express them, but he’s just as quick to adjust when better ideas emerge. Once aligned, he commits fully to the goal and moves fast.\n\nI believe Benoit thrives in early-stage or high-ownership teams, especially where the product matters and there’s room to make a real impact. If you’re building something important and need someone who will run at the problem, learn fast, and remain relentlessly committed to solving it, then I recommend Benoit.""}]},""languageSkills"":{""Espagnol"":"""",""Anglais"":"""",""Allemand"":""""},""skills"":[""Amazon Web Services"",""Produits Docker"",""AWS EKS"",""Amazon EKS"",""AWS Lambda"",""Apache Kafka"",""Pandas (logiciel)"",""Data Build Tool (DBT)"",""Tableau"",""NumPy"",""Apache Spark"",""Apache Airflow"",""Superset"",""Google BigQuery"",""Databricks"",""Snowflake"",""Modélisation des données"",""Architecture de données"",""FastAPI"",""Kubernetes"",""Spring Boot"",""Kotlin"",""React.js"",""Next.js"",""Python (langage de programmation)"",""Secteur des paiements"",""Norme PCI DSS"",""Développement de logiciels""],""linkedinProfile"":""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoitlienart-python-data"",""providerId"":""ACoAAAFpoToBTLMeup4o8CiZQsbDxpKEHdQnBiw"",""headline"":""Senior Data Engineer - Airflow / Databricks / dbt / Python"",""first_name"":""Benoit"",""work_experience"":[{""skills"":[""FastAPI"",""Python (langage de programmation)"",""Spring Boot"",""Kubernetes"",""Kotlin"",""Next.js"",""React.js"",""Databricks"",""Google BigQuery"",""Apache Spark"",""Apache Kafka"",""Pandas (logiciel)"",""Apache Airflow"",""AWS Lambda"",""Data Build Tool (DBT)"",""Produits Docker""],""company_id"":""5015191"",""companyInformation"":{""employee_count"":59,""website"":""https://www.shc-group.de/"",""profile_url"":""https://www.linkedin.com/company/shc-group-de/"",""description"":""A market lab and powerhouse for digital innovation in critical infrastructure that affects everybody’s life.

- Ihr Spezialist für Werkstatt, Haus und Garten\n\nIm Jahr 1960 begann in Mannheim eine Erfolgsgeschichte, die ihresgleichen sucht: Im Frühjahr eröffnete BAUHAUS dort sein erstes Fachcentrum.

Eine riesige Auswahl, erstklassige Qualität zu günstigen Preisen und eine gute Erreichbarkeit gehörten von Anfang an zu den Grundprinzipien des Unternehmens. Nach wie vor bilden sie die Basis für den Erfolg!\n\nMit über 270 Fachcentren in 19 Ländern gehört BAUHAUS zu den erfolgreichsten Handelsunternehmen Europas. Und BAUHAUS wächst stetig weiter! Das Erfolgsrezept ist dabei kein Geheimnis. Es sind die motivierten und engagierten Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, die jeden Tag - mit Herzblut und einem hohen Serviceanspruch - alles für ihre Kunden geben.\n\nDie Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter sind das wertvollste Kapital.\n\nOberste Priorität genießen deshalb die Personalförderung und -entwicklung.
