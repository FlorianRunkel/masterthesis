Das Besondere: Unsere Kunde*innen sind zugleich unsere Mitglieder. Vertrauen, Nähe und Sicherheit sind die Basis unserer Arbeit – im Netzwerk unserer Verbandsfamilie und der Genossenschaftlichen FinanzGruppe.\nWir leben eine gewachsene, demokratische Kultur. Klare Mitgliederorientierung, Qualität und Leistung sind für uns selbstverständlich. Rund 1.500 Mitarbeiter*innen betreuen und beraten die Mitglieder. Dabei denken wir nicht nur nach, sondern auch vor: Wir analysieren den Markt und erkennen Trends. Wir geben Antworten auf komplexe Fragen und Sachverhalte und zeigen unseren Genossenschaften Lösungen auf.\nWir fördern die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit unserer Kund*innen langfristig – seit 1862. Dabei sind wir nicht nur erfolgsorientiert, sondern stellen auch den gesellschaftlichen Sinn in den Fokus. Aktiv fördern wir das Genossenschaftswesen durch Gründungsinitiativen sowie eine intensive Interessenvertretung. Wir sind Sprachrohr unserer Mitglieder innerhalb und außerhalb des Verbundes.\nZur Mitgliedernähe zählt auch die regionale Nähe. Der Genoverband berücksichtigt dies in seiner dezentralen Leistungserbringung, auf Regionalität basierende Gremienstrukturen sowie eine dezentrale Standortpolitik.\nSeit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts stehen Genossenschaften nach den Prinzipien von Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen und Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch für praktizierte Wirtschaftsdemokratie, für Selbsthilfe, Selbstverwaltung und Selbstverantwortung. Die Arbeit des Genoverbands orientiert sich an diesen genossenschaftlichen Werten.
